# Automatically labels a pull request as "stacked PR" if it is stacked,
# i.e., not merging into the repo's default branch but into another PR.
#
# - Removes label automatically once target branch is changed to repo's default branch.
# - Prevents merging stacked PRs.
# - Ignores 'release/*' branches.
